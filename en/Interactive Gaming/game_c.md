# Cocos Creator Quickstart
## Prerequisites

Development environment:

- Cocos Creator v2.0.9 or later.
- A certified Cocos Creator account.
- An Android or iOS device for the mobile end.
- No VPN connection.
- Ensure that the browser for the Web end meets the [requirements](https://docs.agora.io/en/Interactive%20Broadcast/start_live_web?platform=Web#prerequisites).

## Integrate the Agora Service

Create a Cocos Creator project and enable the Agora Service in your project with the following steps:

1. Open your project with Cocos Creator. Choose **Panel** and **Service** in the drop-down menu. The **Service** panel appears on the right.

2. On the **Service** panel, select the game your just created and click **Association**.

	When the association completes, the **Agora Service** panel appears in the **Service** panel.

4. Click **Dashboard** button in the panel to go to Agora **Console**.

	The Console automatically creates an Agora project. Click open the project and get your Agora App ID. You need to pass the App ID when initializing the RtcEngine.

   Now you successfully enable the **Agora Service** for your Cocos Creator project and get the Agora App ID. Cocos Creator automatically downloads and configures all the Agora's depenencies.

## Call the APIs to enable the audio function

You can now call the APIs to enable the audio function in your Cocos Creator project:

### API call sequence

Enable the audio function with the following APIs:

1. Initialize the RtcEngine: [agora && agora.init(appid);](../../en/Interactive%20Gaming/game_coco.md)
2. Join the channel: [agora && agora.joinChannel("", channel, "", 0);](../../en/Interactive%20Gaming/game_coco.md)
3. Leave the channel:  [agora && agora.leaveChannel();](../../en/Interactive%20Gaming/game_coco.md)

Register the following callback events in the `agora.on` method:

* `agora.on('join-channel-success', this.onJoinChannelSuccess, this);`: Occurs when the user joins the channel.
* `agora.on('leave-channel', this.onLeaveChannel, this);`: Occurs when the user leaves the channel.
* `agora.on('rejoin-channel-success', this.onRejoinChannelSuccess, this);`: Occurs when the user rejoins the channel.

For more callback events, see the API reference for [agora.on](../../en/Interactive%20Gaming/game_coco.md).

### Sample Code

Agora provides an open-souce [Cocos Creator Voice Demo](https://github.com/AgoraIO/Voice-Call-for-Mobile-Gaming/tree/master/Basic-Voice-Call-for-Gaming/Hello-CocosCreator-Voice-Agora). You can download and refer to the code logic in the sample code.

### API reference
